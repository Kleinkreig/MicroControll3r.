MicroControll3r
================

> **Built for HackClub Blueprint**

What is this?
-------------

**MicroControll3r.** is a hackpad designed to be simple and configurable. It's a multi-purpose, part-swappable board powered by the **Raspberry Pi RP2040**.

You can use it as a macro pad for your PC, or reconfigure it as a mini computer.

Features
-------------

-   **Modular & Swappable:** Don't replace the board---just upgrade it. You are able to use ESPs, Arduinos and many other CPUs in the XIAO family.

    -   *Need Wi-Fi?* Add in an ESP32 module.

    -   *Need output?* Add an OLED.

    -   *Need feedback?* Swap in a haptic motor driver.


The Specs
---------

-   **CPU:** Raspberry Pi RP2040 (Dual-core ARM Cortex M0+)

-   **Ports:** USB-C (Power & Data)

-   **Power:** USB 5V

Required Parts/Parts That I Need From HackClub
----------------------------------------------
-  Seeed XIAO RP2040 (x1)
-  SK6812 MINI-E LEDs (x4)
-  Blank DSA keycaps (x4)
-  MX-Style switches (x4)
-  Soldering Iron (x1)
  (I would also require the keycaps and switches to be 3D printed since I do not own a 3D printer)

NOTE: I did not want to create a case as I might buy more componenets later. This is also my first experience with CAD and designing PCBs so judge this project as just a test.
